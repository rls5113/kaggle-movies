We learn that Jack, is Jack McCloud, a Star White Socks baseball player in 1941, who dropped out of the league, after his first season, and; ""was never heard from again"" ...  A wonderful story.  We witness magic between a boy's imagination, and Jack's dog, and are never sure if we are witnessing imagination or magic by the dog.  A story of friendship, family, and learning that life isn't always as cut and dried as we often believe.",11.002046,/ub79b63JJV4oeHwomSy5OS5fVsr.jpg,"[{'name': 'Savoy Pictures', 'id': 11308}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",10/27/1995,7025496,115,"[{'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,"If you really believe, magic will find you",Three Wishes,FALSE,6.1,18
